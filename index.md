Hey! 

I am a computer scientist (B. Sc./M. Sc.) who discovered the fascinating world of biology (PhD) and is now working on the intersection of the two fields. In 2021, I completed my PhD at the University of ETH Zurich in the department of Biology with the title "One layer at a time â€“ disentangling canonical and noncanonical roles of the RNAi pathway in embryonic stem cells"". After this exciting journey on gene regulation, I developed a curiosity for the function of proteins on the structural level. And, on how to discover and exploit Biology on the molecular level using Deep Learning.

Currently, I am working as a postdoctoral researcher at MedUni Vienna & CeMM under the supervision of Christoph Bock on deep learning-driven protein design.
